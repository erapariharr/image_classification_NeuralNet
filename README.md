# image_classification_NeuralNet

Context:
There are many features of a sink, e.g the shape, size, and objects around it, that can help us distinguish between a kitchen sink and a bathroom sink using image data. In this Kaggle task, we will provide images of kitchen and bathroom sinks, and you will have to classify them into the right category using an image classification model.


Task:
You are expected to build a classifier that will predict whether an image showed a kitchen sink or a bathroom sink. For this task, we will provide you two folders: images_train and images_test. Each folder is a collection of images.

Inside images_train, there are two subfolders. Each subfolder contains images of the corresponding category (kitchen or bathroom). You can use these images to train your model.

The images_test folder contains a set of 149 images that you need to classify (and submit the results) using your classifier.
